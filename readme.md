# Swift Cheat Sheet

These are things that I lookup frequently or solutions I spent some time on. I hope they can help you too.

(in order)
* Creating background gradients
* Playing a sound with AVFoundation
* Editing the text of a UIButton
* Setting the value of a textField a variety of ways
* Removing the keyboard from the view
* Focusing on a textFiel and bringing up the keyboard
* Hiding the status bar at the top of the view (the one with the battery and clock)
* Getting the last value of a model from CoreData
* Better storage of objects in CoreData
* More to come
